Human and Ball Animation using OpenGL (GLEW + FreeGLUT)

This project demonstrates simple animations of a human figure and a bouncing ball using OpenGL, GLEW, and FreeGLUT libraries. The human figure performs a leg movement animation, while the ball exhibits a bouncing motion.

Prerequisites

Visual Studio
GLEW Library
FreeGLUT Library

How to Run

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Make sure the GLEW and FreeGLUT libraries are properly linked to the project.
Build and run the project.

Files Included

main.cpp: Contains the main code for the animation of a human figure and a bouncing ball.
glew.h: GLEW header file.
freeglut.h: FreeGLUT header file.

Controls

Press the Spacebar to toggle animation on/off.
Use the Arrow Keys to rotate the scene:
x/X: Rotate around the X-axis.
y/Y: Rotate around the Y-axis.
z/Z: Rotate around the Z-axis.
Press Esc to exit the program.

Features

The human figure performs a leg movement animation, simulating a walking motion.
The ball exhibits a bouncing motion within the defined limits.
Scene rotation allows viewing the animation from different angles.

Additional Notes

The animation for the human figure and the ball is achieved through incremental changes in their positions over time.
Scene rotation provides a dynamic view of the animation.
The animation can be toggled on/off to observe individual frames.
